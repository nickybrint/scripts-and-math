## scripts
### XKCDWallpaper.py
A hack to easily change your windows wallpaper. Downloads an XKCD comic, (puts it on top of a neat gradient background), and saves it in your C:/Users/Public folder twice. All you have to do is set your wallpaper to slideshow between those two images, and then if you run the script again, it changes the images, and when the slideshow changes, your wallpaper changes.
### FunctionMinimizer.py
A python script that minimizes a function by writing *another python script*. Completely useless.
## math
### analyzeABC.py
The solution to a Capture the Flag, where the flag was hidden in abc.txt.
### DivisiblePandigital.py
