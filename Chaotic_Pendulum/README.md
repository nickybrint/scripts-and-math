# Chaotic_Pendulum
Simulations of a few sometimes chaotic pendulum-based scenarios. Uses Tkinter (GUI library).
These are pretty stable, but eventually either converge or diverge due to rounding errors.
(There is a thing called the Runge-Kutta method (basically a complicated formula), which greatly reduces the rounding errors. I might implement it in the future.)

#### SimplePendulum.py
A simulation of a simple pendulum.
#### DoublePendulum.py
A draggable simulation of a double pendulum. (This is how I learned about the Lagrangian! (if you care))
#### PhysicalDoublePendulum.py
A simulation of a 'physical' double pendulum (i.e. with solid bars)
#### CircleRotation.py
What happens if you replace a line with a circle.
