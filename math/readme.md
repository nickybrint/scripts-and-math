# math
#### analyzeABC.py
The solution to a Capture the Flag. Generates flag.png from abc.txt.
#### ContinuedFractionPeriods.py
Finds the number of periodic continued fractions of sqrt(n) that have an odd period.
#### DivisiblePandigital.py
Finds all 0 to 9 pandigital numbers such that 17 (the 7th prime) divides (digit8),(digit9),(digit10) 13|d7d8d9, 11|d6d7d8, etc.

*ex: 4160357289 ==> 17 divides 289, 13|728, 11|572, 7|357, 5|035, 3|603, and 2|160*
#### DijkstraTriangle.py
Uses Djikstra's Algoriithm to find the highest-valued path through a triangle of numbers.
#### PolygonNumbers.py
Uses recursion to find a 6-cycle of 4-digit polygonal numbers (numbers that can be represented as dots arranged in the shape of a regular polygon) such that each number's last two digits are the first two digits of the next number.
#### PrimeSumFinder.py
Prints the prime less than 1,000,000 that can be written as the longest sequence of consecutive primes.
#### TotientPermutation.py
Minimizes n/totient(n), on n where (n, totient(n)) are permutations of the same digits.
