#### analyzeABC.py
The solution to a Capture the Flag. Generates flag.png from abc.txt.
#### DivisiblePandigital.py
Finds all [0-9] pandigital numbers such that 17 (the 7th prime) divides (digit8),(digit9),(digit10) 13|d7d8d9, 11|d6d7d8, etc.
#### DijkstraTriangle.py
Uses Djikstra's Algoriithm to find the highest-valued path through a triangle of numbers.
#### PolygonNumbers.py
Uses recursion to find a 6-cycle of 4-digit polygonal numbers (numbers that can be represented as dots arranged in the shape of a regular polygon) such that each number's last two digits are the first two digits of the next number.
#### TotientPermutation.py
Minimizes n/totient(n), on n where (n, totient(n)) are permutations of the same digits.
